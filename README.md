# LR04 Benthic Stack Visualisation
  
## Introduction
This repository was created to practice using R again. In particular I wanted to practice visualising data in R. I have chosen to use the LR04 benthic stack data (Lisiecki & Raymo, 2005) as this is something that is relevant to my PhD research so I might actually use the visualisations I create.  
  
## The LR04 Benthic Stack
The LR04 benthic stack contains benthic &#948;<sup>18</sup>O measurements from marine sediment cores obtained from 57 different sites. The record spans 5.3 million years and represents a combination of global ice volume and deep-water temperature signals through time. High &#948;<sup>18</sup>O measurements reflect larger global ice volumes that are indicative of cold glacial periods while lower &#948;<sup>18</sup>O measurements reflect lower global ice volumes that are indicative of warmer interglacial periods.
